# I built myself a hugo website.

## Here is how I did it

Where to start? I initially looked at using Hugo with Azure Static Web Apps to modernise a website that I built for people new into my role. What I discovered is that is going to take me lots of time to learn the in's and out's of Hugo before I can port that across.

__So What is Hugo?__

Hugo is the world's fastest framework for building websites. It can be picked up by anyone even if they do not have any real knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, as there are a lot of themes that are avaiable to deploy that will let you start getting information out in minutes.
